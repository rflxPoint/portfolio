          From August to October of 2023, I initiated an internship at ABC Studios Southbank, working with the Gardening Australia team to learn about TV post-production. My main point of contact was with the Assistant Editors of the program, assisting them with various items.
          <br></br>
          My main task over the intern period was completing the video compile for the 'Jobs for the Weekend' segments for episodes 28 through 38 of Season 34. Graphics for the segment had already been completed prior to my arrival, so all I needed to was sift through the server and loose back-up drives for the writer's and researcher's desired clips, put them into the episode timeline.
          <br></br>
          Then, I'd apply various effects to them so to focus on the subject matter <i>only</i>, and make sure they run the same length as the voice over that had been recorded for the segment.
