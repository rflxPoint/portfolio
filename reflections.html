          <p> <i> Reflections </i> is a interactive experience made in Unity, and communicates the awkwardness of non-physical bodies interacting with objects in a way that does not come about normally. It is an experience that players in video games experience when colliding with objects and players and being moved by them - like wearing a large pack in a crowded train.
